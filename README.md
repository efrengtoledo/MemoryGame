**Memory Game** is a Light & Sound Memory game to apply for CodePath's SITE Program. 

Submitted by: **NAME**

Time spent: **#** hours spent in total

Link to project: (insert your link here, should start with https://glitch.com...)

## Required Functionality

The following **required** functionality is complete:

* [ ] Game interface has a heading (h1 tag), a line of body text (p tag), and four buttons that match the demo app
* [ ] "Start" button toggles between "Start" and "Stop" when clicked. 
* [ ] Game buttons each light up and play a sound when clicked. 
* [ ] Computer plays back sequence of clues including sound and visual cue for each button
* [ ] Play progresses to the next turn (the user gets the next step in the pattern) after a correct guess. 
* [ ] User wins the game after guessing a complete pattern
* [ ] User loses the game after an incorrect guess

The following **optional** features are implemented:

* [ ] Any HTML page elements (including game buttons) has been styled differently than in the tutorial
* [ ] Buttons use a pitch (frequency) other than the ones in the tutorial
* [ ] More than 4 functional game buttons
* [ ] Playback speeds up on each turn
* [ ] Computer picks a different pattern each time the game is played
* [ ] Player only loses after 3 mistakes (instead of on the first mistake)
* [ ] Game button appearance change goes beyond color (e.g. add an image)
* [ ] Game button sound is more complex than a single tone (e.g. an audio file, a chord, a sequence of multiple tones)
* [ ] User has a limited amount of time to enter their guess on each turn

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [ ] List anything else that you can get done to improve the app!

## Reflection Questions
1. If you used any outside resources to help complete your submission (websites, books, people, etc) list them here.

2. What was a challenge you encountered in creating this submission (be specific)? How did you overcome it? (recommended 200 - 400 words) 
The biggest challenge I faced was understanding and implementing the logic behind the game. Using a bunch of nested conditional statements could get confusing, so I started off by breaking down which conditional statements do what. The first conditional statement checks whether or not the user clicks the right button. If so, we then check if our progress count matches our guess count. If so, we check if our progress count is equivalent to the length of the list. If so, we win the game. If progress is not equivalent to the length of the list, we then increment our progress count by 1, until it reaches the length of the list and start the clue sequence again. If the guess does not match the selected number in the pattern list, then we get that answer wrong and increment the wrong count by 1. If wrong count is three, we lose the game. It is important to understand how the game works, in order to add additional features to the logic.  

3. What questions about web development do you have after completing your submission? (recommended 100 - 300 words) 
Something I kept thinking about

4. If you had a few more hours to work on this project, what would you spend them doing (for example: refactoring certain functions, adding additional features, etc). Be specific. (recommended 100 - 300 words)
